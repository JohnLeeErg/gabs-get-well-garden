# authors

I'm imagining this game will get posted on itch eventually; add yourself to the list here (with a link to your itch page or wherever) so we can put a list of all authors in the game's description

* [droqen](https://droqen.com)
* [pancelor](https://pancelor.com)
* [Ash K](https://ash-k.dev/)
* [Jack Kutilek](https://jackkutilek.com/)
* [mokesmoe](https://mokesmoe.itch.io/)
