# how 2 godot

hi! welcome to godot. there are one thousand tutorials out there if you want to really learn it deeply; this doc is not really gonna attempt to teach you it but it'll summarize the very basic workflow needed to contribute simple stuff to this game.

the [tutorial vid](https://youtu.be/zHSClw8jJzw) might also be useful

umm everything is a "node"; you can attach nodes to other nodes (e.g. attach a sprite node to your drifter node, or attach a particle system node). you can also attach scripted behavior to nodes, like what to do when the player clicks on it. this is written in a custom python-like language called gdscript.

sometimes you wrap up a little tree of nodes into a "scene" which makes that node-tree easy to create all at once in-game.

## how to download

get godot here: https://godotengine.org/download

I personally downloaded godot through the [itch desktop app](https://itch.io/app) so godot auto-updates to the latest version, which is probably(?) a good thing. https://godotengine.itch.io/godot
