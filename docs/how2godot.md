# how 2 godot

hi! welcome to godot. there are one thousand tutorials out there if you want to really learn it deeply; this doc is not really gonna attempt to teach you it but it'll summarize the very basic workflow needed to contribute simple stuff to this game.

the [tutorial vid](./video.md) I'm putting up later (not available yet) should also be useful

umm everything is a "node"; you can attach nodes to other nodes (e.g. attach a sprite node to your drifter node, or attach a particle system node). you can also attach scripted behavior to nodes, like what to do when the player clicks on it. this is written in a custom python-like language called gdscript.
