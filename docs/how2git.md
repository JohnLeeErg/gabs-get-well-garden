# how 2 git

git is very useful for collaborating! but also kinda a hassle, especially if you're not comfortable with it

## option 1: use git

this guide should help:

## option 2: send me your code and I'll add it for you

there's a dedicated thread in `#get-well` that I (pancelor) will check occasionally. just zip up your folder (e.g. `DriftersUserDefined/pancelor/`) and send it in the thread. if you want to edit it later, rezip and resend the folder after editing

is this too much work for me? hopefully not! just don't expect me to be very responsive :sweat_smile:
hopefully this lets people contribute that might otherwise not!
